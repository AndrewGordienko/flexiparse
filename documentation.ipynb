    "# FlexiParse Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "The **FlexiParse** library allows for dynamic parsing of JSON response data from Opensearch and converts it into a structured CSV format. It's designed to handle any response, including data, voice, and SMS usage, without the need for hardcoded loops, making it flexible and reusable for future reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features:\n",
    "- Dynamically processes JSON request and response files from Opensearch\n",
    "- Automatically detects and handles SMS-specific fields such as SMS counts\n",
    "- Supports flexible CSV export of structured data\n",
    "- Dynamically reorders columns based on the contents of the response\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "Install the library using pip:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install flexiparse\n",
    "```\n",
    "Ensure the following dependencies are installed:\n",
    "- pandas\n",
    "- json\n",
    "- sys\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup and Usage\n",
    "You can use **FlexiParse** by calling its main function to process a request and response file and save the output as a CSV file. Here's an example setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flexiparse.main import process_data\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define your request, response, and output files\n",
    "request_file = 'data-api-request.json'\n",
    "response_file = 'data-api-response.json'\n",
    "output_csv = 'output_data.csv'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Process data\n",
    "df = process_data(request_file, response_file, output_csv)\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Displaying the DataFrame\n",
    "Optionally, you can print the DataFrame using the following function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flexiparse.main import display_dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display the parsed DataFrame\n",
    "display_dataframe(df)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functionality Breakdown\n",
    "- **extract_field_mappings_from_request**: Parses the request file and extracts the aggregation mappings for the fields.\n",
    "- **parse_buckets**: Recursively goes through the JSON response to dynamically build rows of data.\n",
    "- **process_data**: Main function to process the request and response files and generate a CSV.\n",
    "- **display_dataframe**: Displays the parsed DataFrame to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complete Workflow Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flexiparse.main import process_data, display_dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 1: Provide your JSON request and response files\n",
    "request_file = 'data-api-request.json'\n",
    "response_file = 'data-api-response.json'\n",
    "output_csv = 'output_data.csv'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 2: Process the files\n",
    "df = process_data(request_file, response_file, output_csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 3: Optionally display the DataFrame\n",
    "display_dataframe(df)\n",
    "\n",
    "# The parsed data will be saved to the output CSV file.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "- The library dynamically processes JSON data, meaning it will adapt to new fields or aggregations that may be added in the future.\n",
    "- The library automatically identifies and processes SMS-related fields when applicable.\n",
    "- Volume-related fields such as 'downlinkVolume' and 'uplinkVolume' are automatically sorted to the end of the CSV.\n",
